## Project Idea
Decentralized Marketplace for crowd-sourced, AI-agents for all things finance.

We're creating an AI-powered investment advisor marketplace. Why rely on the judgment of a single AI when you can have an entire army of specialized agents at your fingertips? 

Each agent is equipped with unique skills, from scouring the internet and analyzing financial reports to uncover hidden opportunities, to constantly monitoring candlestick patterns for the next strategic move. 

The complexity of hedge fund operations shows a clear demand for a marketplace where these specialized AI agents can thrive and deliver precise, actionable insights.

This vision is enhanced by enabling everyday users to create specialized agents simply by chatting with our bot. Through a chat interface, users can easily develop these agents, which can then be sold and utilized on the marketplace, allowing the creators to earn revenue from their contributions.

### XMTP Chat Interface

Our platform leverages XMTP for secure, decentralized messaging, enabling us to process agent creation prompts and interact with smart contracts to deploy and manage AI agents on the blockchain, ensuring privacy and reliability throughout the process.

### Hedera Consensus Service

Hedera enables secure and efficient internal dialogue for AI agents through its distributed consensus service, allowing for rapid and reliable decision-making in decentralized environments.

### Galadrieal Factory Contract

Galadriel is a Layer 1 blockchain specifically designed for AI applications, allowing developers to build decentralized AI solutions using familiar Solidity smart contracts, effectively bridging the gap between blockchain and artificial intelligence.

### Web3Auth 

Web3Auth integration provides a seamless onboarding experience, allowing users to authenticate using familiar Web2 providers while securely connecting to blockchain wallets. This approach significantly reduces entry barriers for new users while maintaining the security benefits of Web3 technology.

### Lit Protocol

Lit Protocol offers decentralized encryption and access control mechanisms, ensuring robust protection for user privacy and sensitive data in blockchain-based applications, enhancing overall security and trust.

## Challenges we Faced

1. On-demand agent creation allows the system to dynamically generate and deploy agents tailored to specific user tasks or needs in real-time. These agents are designed to execute actions and respond based on user requirements.

2. Web3 authentication enables secure, decentralized transaction handling on behalf of users. This ensures that all blockchain-based actions are authenticated without compromising the user's control or ownership of their assets.

3. Privacy protection is a core feature, ensuring that users' personal details remain encrypted and inaccessible to unauthorized parties. The system is designed to handle sensitive data with strict confidentiality and security protocols.

4. Agent communication facilitates seamless interactions between autonomous agents, enabling them to collaborate, share information, and execute complex tasks in a coordinated manner. This inter-agent dialogue ensures efficient problem-solving and task management, which has been incorporated using Hedera.
